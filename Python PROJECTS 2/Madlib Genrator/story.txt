Today I went to the zoo with my <friend_name>. We saw a huge <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its cage.
The zookeeper told us it loves to eat <food>. After that, we watched a <adjective> <animal_2> swing from the trees.
I got to feed a <color> <animal_3> some <snack>. It was so <adjective_2>!
Before leaving, we rode a <vehicle> around the zoo, and my <relative> bought me a <adjective_3> <noun> as a souvenir.
It was the most <emotion> day ever!
